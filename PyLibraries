Tools for Creating Interfaces in Python  

------------------------------------------

1. PAGE (Python Automatic GUI)  
Description: A tool for creating interfaces based on Tkinter.  
Official Website: [PAGE](https://page.sourceforge.io/)  
Advantages: Simple and visual.  
Disadvantages: Generated code can be difficult to maintain.

2. Qt Designer (For PyQt or PySide)  
Description: A visual tool included in the Qt Framework to intuitively design graphical interfaces.  
How it works:  
- Drag and drop widgets (buttons, text boxes, etc.) in a visual editor.  
- Export the design as a `.ui` file, which can be converted to Python using tools like `pyuic` (for PyQt) or `pyside-uic` (for PySide).  
Highlights:  
- Full support for layouts, styles, and modern themes.  
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).  
Installation: Part of the Qt package. Can be installed separately with PyQt/PySide.

3. wxFormBuilder (For wxPython)  
Description: A visual editor for creating interfaces using the wxPython framework.  
How it works:  
- Create interfaces with native widgets in the editor.  
- Export layouts as Python code or XML files that can be loaded with wxPython.  
Highlights:  
- Support for native-looking interfaces on Windows, macOS, and Linux.  
- Ideal for GUIs that feel "native."  
Installation: Available for download from the official wxFormBuilder website.

4. Kivy Designer (For Kivy)  
Description: A visual editor for creating interfaces with the Kivy framework.  
How it works:  
- Allows you to visually create `.kv` files, which define the interface in Kivy's style.  
- Interfaces are designed to be responsive, especially for mobile devices.  
Highlights:  
- Focus on modern and responsive interfaces.  
- Support for custom themes.  
Installation: The project is not officially maintained, but forks with support are available on GitHub.

5. Glade (For Gtk+)  
Description: A visual tool for designing interfaces with the Gtk+ framework (accessible via PyGObject in Python).  
How it works:  
- Create GUIs by dragging and dropping widgets.  
- Export `.glade` or `.xml` files that can be dynamically loaded in Python.  
Highlights:  
- Lightweight interfaces that integrate well with Linux systems.  
- Support for themes and internationalization.  
Installation: Available in Linux package managers or for download.

6. Figma/Adobe XD + PyWebview (For PyWebview)  
Description: Modern design tools like Figma or Adobe XD allow you to visually create interfaces that can be exported as HTML/CSS. These interfaces can be integrated into Python using PyWebview.  
How it works:  
- Design visually in Figma or Adobe XD.  
- Export as front-end code (HTML/CSS/JS).  
- Use PyWebview to integrate them with a Python backend.  
Highlights:  
- Enables creation of extremely modern interfaces.  
- Flexibility to use web technologies.

7. GtkBuilder via Stetic (MonoDevelop)  
Description: Similar to Glade, but integrated into the MonoDevelop IDE.  
How it works:  
- Design GUIs visually and export `.ui` or `.glade` files.  
- Use with PyGObject to create Gtk-style GUIs.  
Highlights:  
- Focused on Linux systems.  
- An alternative to Glade.
